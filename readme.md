# Custom Build Form
#####  A custom build form – the user can add or remove fields at will. The fields to be added or are 2 types – text & select. When the user saves the data from the form, all the data is displayed in a table.
##### Used only : JS and JQuery. It is not super designed because I based on the funcionality of the form.
